"A rebel's paradise" Jan 8th 2026

The unassuming flora of Central Alborz mountains of Iran, emerging from rocky crevices and bursting into expression in spite of all harshness. Grain by grain, they carve their way out to greet the sun, with roots planted firmly. An embodiment of persisting will and motion in nature, a kindling for hope, life, and freedom.
We can emerge as well, to dance freely and gloriously with every breeze. Let nature be the reminder that change will always be inevitable.

"First breath"
date: January 4th 2026

The first breath is often the freshest. The first inhale as you reach the opening of a headtrail, leading up to distant mountains, away from the noise and pollution of the city. The moment of emergence from icy waters and the first exhale of vapour across ice sheets where a dense forest stands in watch up-ahead.
